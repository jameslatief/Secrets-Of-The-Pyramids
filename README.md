***Secrets Of The Pyramids***

*Secrets Of The Pyramids is a project that is built upon London App Brewery's Destini Choose Your Own Adventure App and content from [Choose Your Own Adventures #19: Secret of the Pyramids](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1n4i-V5GM0fGS0C-mF8-XB9tAJHwFA6nM) Book by Richard Brightfield . I do not claim any ownership on these copyright content and do not intend to use it for any commercial purpose at any time. This Flutter project is a practice project to showcase what I have learned through the course (February 4 - March 1 2020) and serves as a good exercise for me to complete a project from beginning to the end. This project has been tested on both Android and iOS and can be built with a properly configured Android Studio.*
